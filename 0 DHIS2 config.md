Needs to have at least the following, for each stage. 

If we do both stages together, then 9.1 can benefit from maps.

for 9.1:
- orgunits w/ hierarchy
- dataelements etc for 'sprayed_count'
- program etc
- users (incl a user who can see all orgunits)
- chart + table for sprayedcount

for 9.2:
- orgunits w/ hierarchy (incl. GIS)
- dataelement for worldpop or other denominator
- indicator for coverage, etc
