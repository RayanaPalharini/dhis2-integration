Needs to have at least the following, for each stage. 

If we do both 9.1 and 9.2 together, then 9.1 can benefit from maps on the dashboard, etc.

for 9.1:
- orgunits w/ hierarchy
- dataelements etc for `sprayed_count`
- program etc
- users (incl a user who can see all orgunits)
- chart + table for sprayedcount

for 9.2:
- orgunits w/ hierarchy (incl. GIS)
- dataelement for `worldpop` or other denominator
- indicator for coverage, etc
